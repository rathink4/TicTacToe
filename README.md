# TicTacToe
A Java GUI based TicTacToe game application

This application uses the minimax algorithm for the AI to play the best possible move once you place your move on the board.
You can use the Alpha-Beta prunning algorithm too on this code by some slight modification and it will work too.
I used the Java swing and awt toolkits to make the GUI and to draw the O and X. There is an easier way to put the Xs and Os in the board
but i found that drawing them looks better.

Hope my project helped you.
